This document defines the core principles of the Contribution Protocol.
Implementations are free;
however, any implementation that deviates from the principles set forth in this document
shall be treated as a distinct lineage, separate from CP.


The following is not a strategy,
but an inviolable prerequisite of the Contribution Protocol
that precedes all subsequent developments.


----------------------- 
Reversible / Irreversible Layers
-----------------------
The Contribution Protocol clearly separates the system into
a “modifiable operational layer” and an “irreversible guarantee layer.”


DB Layer (Reversible Operational Layer)

The DB layer is the layer in which the system is actually operated.

- It stores records of actions and transactions
- Visualization and day-to-day circulation take place here
- Human and organizational operations and judgments are involved
- Damage, migration, and updates are assumed


Smart Contract Layer (Irreversible Guarantee Layer)
 
The Smart Contract layer does not operate the system;
it fixes only the conditions of the system.

- No human or organizational judgment is involved
- Value expires over time
- Issuance that does not satisfy the defined conditions cannot occur
- Participants may exit the system at any time and are not bound
- These conditions cannot be altered afterward


Through this separation,
the Contribution Protocol continues to exist as a structure
without turning toward coercion or exploitation,
even in the absence of operators, founders, or well-intentioned stewards.

Furthermore, when participants are absent,
a quiet halt of the structure of CP itself is permitted.


Note:
In this specification, when the term “smart contract” is used,
it refers to a representative example of an execution mechanism
that is irreversible and automatically enforced,
and does not permit human intervention.
It is not limited to any specific technology.
