This document defines the core principles of the Contribution Protocol.
Implementations are free to vary, but
those that diverge from the principles set out here
are treated as belonging to a different lineage from CP.



Note:
The following is not a strategy, but an immutable set of prerequisites
that precede all subsequent developments of the Contribution Protocol.


-----------------------
Life / Death Boundary
-----------------------
Contribution Protocol clearly separates the system into
a “living layer” and an “immutable post-mortem guarantee.”


What the DB layer is responsible for (Life)
･ Records
･ Operations
･ Visibility
･ Day-to-day circulation

The DB layer is a living operational layer,
designed with the assumption that it can break, be migrated, and be updated.


What the Smart Contract layer is responsible for (Post-mortem guarantees)
･ Final veto authority
･ Temporary suspension authority
･ Exit guarantees
･ Immutable conditions for issuance and expiration
･ An immutable foundation

The Smart Contract layer performs no operations and makes no judgments.
It guarantees only non-seizability and non-reversibility,
and exists solely as an immutable foundation that prevents the system from breaking.


Through this separation,
the Contribution Protocol can endure the absence of operators, founders,
and even well-intentioned participants,
without devolving into coercion or exploitation.



-----------------------
Graceful Death
-----------------------
The Contribution Protocol
does not enforce its continued existence
in any region or institutional implementation.


Conditions
･ When no one can find hope in the system anymore
･ When no one chooses to participate in, receive from, or operate the system
Under these conditions,
the system must not be forcibly maintained or artificially prolonged.

Behavior
･ New issuance naturally comes to a halt
･ Day-to-day operations gradually fade out
Histories and records are preserved
No individual is forced to bear responsibility


The system is not judged as a failure.
A quiet ending is permitted.

A system that cannot die
inevitably begins to exploit its participants.


CP does not guarantee survival.
It guarantees non-coercion, even at the end.
