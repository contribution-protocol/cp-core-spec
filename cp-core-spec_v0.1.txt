This document defines the core principles of the Contribution Protocol.
Implementations are free;
however, any implementation that deviates from the principles set forth in this document
shall be treated as a distinct lineage, separate from CP.


The following is not a strategy,
but an inviolable prerequisite of the Contribution Protocol
that precedes all subsequent developments.


----------------------- 
Reversible / Irreversible Layers
-----------------------
The Contribution Protocol clearly separates the system into
a “modifiable operational layer” and an “irreversible guarantee layer.”


DB Layer (Reversible Operational Layer)

The DB layer is the layer in which the system is actually operated.

- It stores records of actions and transactions
- Visualization and day-to-day circulation take place here
- Human and organizational operations and judgments are involved
- Damage, migration, and updates are assumed


Smart Contract Layer (Irreversible Guarantee Layer)
 
The Smart Contract layer does not operate the system;
it fixes only the conditions of the system.

- No human or organizational judgment is involved
- Value expires over time
- Issuance that does not satisfy the defined conditions cannot occur
- Participants may exit the system at any time and are not bound
- These conditions cannot be altered afterward


Through this separation,
the Contribution Protocol continues to exist as a structure
without turning toward coercion or exploitation,
even in the absence of operators, founders, or well-intentioned stewards.

Furthermore, when participants are absent,
a quiet halt of the structure of CP itself is permitted.



Note:
In this specification, when the term “smart contract” is used,
it refers to a representative example of an execution mechanism
that is irreversible and automatically enforced,
and does not permit human intervention.
It is not limited to any specific technology.



-----------------------
Evaluation Structure: Prestige (Value Indicator)
-----------------------
Prestige is the accumulation of recorded actions representing contributions made to others,
and serves as a value-based evaluation indicator.

Prestige is not a currency and is not transferable, storable, or exchangeable.

Within the system,
Prestige is treated as the base quantity of voting power
used for decision-making and consensus formation.

When the system performs decision-making or reaches consensus,
the weight of each participant’s judgment
is assigned based on the number of contribution actions to others
recorded within the system.

Contribution actions are classified into predefined types,
and the weight coefficients for each type
are defined by each implementation.
